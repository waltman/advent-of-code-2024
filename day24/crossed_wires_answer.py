# We have 222 output wires.
# To check all pairs, we have 222 Choose 8 / 2^4, or like (222*221/2)(220)... so like something E 15, too big
# => Checking all pairs is ostensibly computationally infeasible

# By manual input inspection, (and gate counting) this is a pretty bog standard ripple adder.
# => We go lower to higher bits, updating our structure.
# The only thing we really carry over from previous layers is the carry bit (which can be wrong)
# So, just assume that we only have 1 thing wrong per gate (as otherwise this would be complicated)

# If we don't utilize the underlying ripple adder structure, this is a VERY complicated problem (to make fast)
# (In general you can brute force by just checking all swap pairs and then verifying correctness, too slow)
# Below are my messy notes working through the problem.


# So, we know what the z wires outputs should look like as logical expressions of the inputs
# If the logic is equivalent, we are good.

# Can we say that if some portion is correct, we should not swap it?
# It may be the case that >= 1 swap may yield a correct result.
# One thing we can say is that a more significant bit should never actually be able to impact a less significant bit.
# Its possible it may end up in the tree as a don't care?
# Well, its always possible that some wire outputs a 0, or outputs a 1 (not sure one 1, given xor) (a ^ a = 0)
# Im just gonna assume we dont have any dont cares.

# If the output of some z is INCORRECT
# Then at least one change MUST occur downstream
# We can iterate from least to most significant digit, and try to make it work.
# Since logically, less significant outputs can be relevent.

# output zi MUST have downstream: x[0..i], y[0..i]
# and (probably) only those.

# The final z output wires can be swapped.

# Assume: there are no useless (connected) outputs in the final solution.

# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_decision_diagram
# It is ordered. (Eric claims it)
# And it will remain ordered. *
# Is this reduced? If its not reduced, can we do anything about it? Not really.
# Equivalence checking is, in general, NP-complete.

# At least can just assume that the inputs from previous Z's are accurate.
# Given only 222 output wires with 45 outputs, we have just under 5 gates per output.
# z is NEVER used as input value.
# 222 = 45 * 45 - 3
#

# In a standard adder, you have out = in1 ^ in2 ^ carry_in
# and carry_out = (carry_in and (in1 ^ in2)) OR (in1 & in2)
# So carry and 1 op, or both ops
# The structure seems to be that of a ripple adder.
# z45 exists.

# z00 is correct.
# adder 0 has 2 gates = 5 - 3
# So all other gates are just bog standard ripple adders.
# We can enforce the ripple adder structure onto it.

# the following gates MUST exist:
# xn AND yn
# xn XOR yn
# We assume for now that x0, y0 is correct.
# We dont know if the output is correct, but we do know they output.

# the x AND y goes into the OR carry guy

# Can we assume to have identified the carry wire?
# well, we know a carry wire.
# While we cant change out inputs, we can change our outputs.
